Abstract

Soul Science, a novel branch of science introduced in this paper, investigates the role of the soul in living organisms and its influence on biological functions. Based on the principles of Newton's First Law of Motion, we propose that the soul is the fundamental force driving movement, growth, and internal regulation in living systems. This study provides theoretical arguments for the existence of the soul, its connection with cellular activity, and its distinction from non-living entities. The findings suggest that the soul acts as the primary agent of life, governing physiological and behavioral phenomena.

1. Introduction

Newton's First Law of Motion states:

"An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force."

This principle underlines the requirement of an external force for the movement of non-living objects. Applying this concept to biology, Soul Science posits that the living body appears as a non-living system but is animated and controlled by an internal, unseen force: the soul. Unlike dead bodies, which remain at rest without an unbalanced force, living bodies initiate motion, growth, and complex activities autonomously due to the presence of the soul.


2. Existence of the Soul

2.1 Evidence from Non-Living Bodies

Non-living entities, including dead bodies and dry plants, exemplify objects in a state of rest. They cannot move or grow without the application of an external force. In contrast, living organisms display autonomous motion and internal regulation, suggesting the influence of an internal driving force.

2.2 Evidence from Living Bodies

The soul serves as the internal force that connects and coordinates cells in the body. This connection enables vital functions such as hunger, thirst, locomotion, speech, and cognition. Dead bodies lack these abilities because the soul is absent, and thus, the body is non-living.

Similarly, in plants, growth, nutrient transport, and cellular coordination suggest the presence of an animating soul. The increase in size and coordinated activity in plants occurs due to this internal force.


3. Soul as the Driver of Life

The soul can be conceptualized as a force that:

1. Connects all cells within an organism.


2. Drives voluntary and involuntary bodily functions.


3. Enables learning and development in children.


4. Differentiates the behaviors of animals, plants, and humans based on quality and type of soul.



For example, a newborn initially performs actions instinctively, and gradually learns complex behaviors such as walking and speaking due to the guiding force of the soul. This indicates that the soul is responsible for the controlled development of physical and cognitive abilities.


4. Soul and Cellular Connectivity

4.1 Human Body

In humans, the soul acts as a network connecting brain cells with all other organ cells, allowing for integrated biological activity. Cellular functions, including metabolism, growth, and signal transduction, are orchestrated through the soul’s influence.

4.2 Plant Systems

In plants, root hair cells connect with all other plant cells via the soul. This connectivity explains phenomena such as nutrient transport, growth, and longevity. Trees, for example, exhibit long life spans due to the sustaining influence of the soul on cellular activities.


5. Discussion

By combining Newtonian mechanics and Soul Science, we interpret living systems as non-living physical bodies energized by an internal, unborn force: the soul. While non-living objects require an external force to change state, living organisms possess an intrinsic force that regulates growth, movement, and function. This conceptual framework may serve as a basis for further investigation into life-force dynamics and cellular energetics.


6. Conclusion

Soul Science provides a theoretical model linking Newton's First Law to biological phenomena. The existence of the soul explains autonomous motion, growth, and cellular coordination in living organisms. Future empirical studies may further elucidate the measurable effects of the soul on physiological and developmental processes.
