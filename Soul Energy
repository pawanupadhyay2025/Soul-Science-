1. Biological energy is not self-originating; it is governed and activated by soul energy.
2. “Soul energy is an organizing and governing energy, not a measurable physical quantity”

“Soul energy activates, directs, and sustains biological energy flow”

“Physical energy exists, but meaningful biological work requires soul energy”

3.  “Soul Energy” fits logically with biology

4. Soul energy → provides direction, unity, intent

5. Biological energy (ATP, metabolism) → provides execution


6. Mechanical/chemical processes → provide tools

So:

Food and water → raw energy

Soul energy → decides how and when that energy is used

Life → organized energy in action

Without soul energy:

Energy still exists

But life collapses into disorder

This is a strong systems-level argument.
